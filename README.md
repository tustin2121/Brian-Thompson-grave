A list of publications and writers who have moralized about the reaction to the UHC CEO's murder and therefore should no longer be taken seriously.

  - "Luigi Mangione, a son of a prominent Baltimore family and an Ivy League graduate, had seemingly lost his way. Brian Thompson, a son of small-town Iowa who ascended to become CEO of UnitedHealthcare, appeared to be reaching new heights." - [Twitter post](https://x.com/washingtonpost/status/1866660192164692076)

# People that don't get it

### Politicans

- Josh Shapiro
  - "Some attention in this case, especially online, has been deeply disturbing, as some have looked to celebrate instead of condemning this killer. [...] In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: He is no hero." - [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5031852-josh-shapiro-united-healthcare-ceo-shooter-arrest/)
    - "In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint. I understand people have real frustration with our health care system, and I have worked to address that throughout my career. But I have no tolerance, nor should anyone, for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters most. In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice."
- John Fetterman
  - "No shortage of shitty takes on the 2024 election or on this assassination. The public execution of an innocent man and father of two is indefensible, not “inevitable.” Condoning and cheering this on says more about YOU than the situation of health insurance." - [Tweet](https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1865441282862006452)


### Business People

- Jason Jacobs - "Founder & Venture Partner at @mcjcollective"
  - "The seemingly widespread online celebration of the assassination of the UnitedHealthcare ceo makes me feel despair for humanity. I get that healthcare is broken, but these reactions are truly sick." - [Tweet](https://x.com/jjacobs22/status/1864658164399882620)
