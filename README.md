# Brian Thompson's grave
A list of publications and writers who have moralized about the reaction to the UHC CEO's murder and therefore should no longer be taken seriously.

### The New York Times
- The Point: [Brian Thompson, Not Luigi Mangione, Is the Real Working-Class Hero](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/04/opinion/thepoint?smid=url-share#brian-thompson-luigi-mangione) - By Bret Stephens (Opinion)
- [UnitedHealthcare C.E.O. Laid to Rest as Family Mourns Privately](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-funeral.html) - By Amy Julia Harris and Ernesto Londoño
- [Torrent of Hate for Health Insurance Industry Follows C.E.O.’s Killing](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/social-media-insurance-industry-brian-thompson.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fE4.fm3v.Yzd8hJFtI4Xu&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) - By Dionne Searcey and Madison Malone Kircher
  - "But that did not stop social media commenters from leaping to conclusions and from showing a blatant lack of sympathy over the death of a man who was a husband and father of two children."
- [Images of Unmasked Suspect Emerge as the Police Track C.E.O.’s Killer](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/brian-thompson-uhc-shooting-suspect-search.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fU4.K4hM.LQ0hrkxtouaV&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) - By Ed Shanahan and Andy Newman
  - "The shooting stunned a city heading into a festive holiday season, shocked an industry that regarded the victim highly, and prompted an ugly outpouring online among those who view health insurers as villains. By Thursday, amid the schadenfreude and grief, the shock had receded as investigators pursued their quarry methodically and New Yorkers were left to wonder when the shooter would be caught."


### The Washington Post
- [Luigi Mangione ‘had so much to offer’ — now, he is a murder suspect](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/12/10/luigi-mangione-life-school-family-back/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main) - By Dan Diamond, Olivia George and Annie Gowen
  - "Luigi Mangione, a son of a prominent Baltimore family and an Ivy League graduate, had seemingly lost his way. Brian Thompson, a son of small-town Iowa who ascended to become CEO of UnitedHealthcare, appeared to be reaching new heights." - [Twitter post](https://x.com/washingtonpost/status/1866660192164692076)


### National Review
- [Luigi Mangione’s Copycat](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/luigi-mangiones-copycat/) - By Haley Strack
  - Again, use of the word "Copycat" for someone who only spoke words.
  - "Mangione has attracted a cult following since he murdered a father of two in cold blood. Thompson’s murder has prompted a nationwide “discussion” on the state of the insurance industry — one laden with excuses and affirmations for disturbed individuals who believe sincerely that murdering high-powered executives is the only way to improve “the system.” Mangione has been described by a shockingly large amount of people as a handsome do-gooder, whose desire to expose the faults of the health care system makes him innocent. He was bound to have a copycat at some point, given that some social-media users have been justifying Mangione’s crime all week. Consider crazed ex-Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz, who said she derived joy from an innocent man’s murder." "Dominic’s post from last week, “Murdering CEOs Is Evil,” generated a terrifying amount of backlash, often from people like Lorenz who think Mangione is a hero for “starting the conversation” about corrupt insurance providers. Mangione might’ve started the conversation. Those who continue it by justifying his bloodlust encourage others to follow in his footsteps."
    - Thompson was not innocent, not just for his company's high rate of denials, but also he was under active investigation for insider trading.
- [Murdering CEOs Is Evil](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/murdering-ceos-is-evil/) - By Dominic Pino
  - "There appears to be some confusion about this online, so here it is plain and simple: Murdering corporate executives is evil."


### Daily Mail
- [First Luigi Mangione copycat is Florida woman who threatened health insurer with words 'he wrote on bullets'](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14187499/Luigi-Mangione-copycat-Florida-woman-threatened-health-insurer.html) - By Bethan Sexton (note use of word "copycat" for a woman who did not kill anyone)


### New York Post
- [Cover of Dec 10, 2024 Issue](https://x.com/schwarz/status/1866561874155782397)
- [Ex-WaPo reporter Taylor Lorenz tells Piers Morgan she felt ‘joy’ over assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson: ‘Feels like justice’ ](https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/ex-wapo-reporter-taylor-lorenz-says-she-felt-joy-over-assassination-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-feels-like-justice/)
  - "Former Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz said she felt “joy” over the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson — doubling down on her unsettling defense of the gruesome execution that left two children without a father."
    - Thompson's children are adults, and are estranged from him.


### The Atlantic
- [The Health-Care System Isn’t Hopeless](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/united-healthcare-insurance-industry-change/680991/) - By Annie Lowrey
  - "The benefits and perils of such proposals lie in their disruptiveness. On the one hand, Americans would never need to worry about losing coverage or have to negotiate with an insurance company again. Businesses would not need to manage their employees' health policies, or pay their share of working preiumums. The government would have  much greater capacity to hold down costs, negotiate drug prices, and invest in public health. On the other hand, Washington would recode one-sith of the American economy, putting dozens of insurers out of operation and perhaps wiping out their shareholders."
    - God forbid we destroy the economy. Won't someone think of the shareholders?

### NBC News
- [Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO slaying played video game killer, friend recalls](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ironic-suspect-unitedhealthcare-slaying-played-video-game-killer-rcna183550) - By Alicia Victoria Lozano
  - "Luigi Mangione [...] once belonged to a group of Ivy League gamers who played assassins, a member of the group told NBC News. In the game, called 'Among Us,' [...]" (Doubles as moralizing about video games... again.)


### USA Today
- [The UnitedHealthcare CEO was killed and many had little sympathy. Why?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/12/05/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killed-meme/76794715007/) - By David Oliver


### CNN

  - "The stunning killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO has shaken C-suites across the country" - Apple News Alert


### Fox News
- "The instagram posts from nut bag people [...] and people celebrating this. This is a sickness, honestly, it's so disappointing, but I guess we shouldn't be surprised. [...] And up next, the other big news out of New York, Daniel Penny, a lot of people think he is a hero, and tonight he's Not Guilty." - [Laura Ingraham](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1866280962084237738)

# People that don't get it

### Politicans

- Josh Shapiro
  - "Some attention in this case, especially online, has been deeply disturbing, as some have looked to celebrate instead of condemning this killer. [...] In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: He is no hero." - [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5031852-josh-shapiro-united-healthcare-ceo-shooter-arrest/)
    - "In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint. I understand people have real frustration with our health care system, and I have worked to address that throughout my career. But I have no tolerance, nor should anyone, for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters most. In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice."
- John Fetterman
  - "No shortage of shitty takes on the 2024 election or on this assassination. The public execution of an innocent man and father of two is indefensible, not “inevitable.” Condoning and cheering this on says more about YOU than the situation of health insurance." - [Tweet](https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1865441282862006452)


### Business People

- Jason Jacobs - "Founder & Venture Partner at @mcjcollective"
  - "The seemingly widespread online celebration of the assassination of the UnitedHealthcare ceo makes me feel despair for humanity. I get that healthcare is broken, but these reactions are truly sick." - [Tweet](https://x.com/jjacobs22/status/1864658164399882620)
